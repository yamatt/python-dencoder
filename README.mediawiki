== Dencoder ==
Another hastily named Python script from yamatt.

This module is designed to help developers who are looking to implement URL shorteners based upon an incrementing number.

Have a look at the unittest for more examples, but source code example is below:

{{{
from dencoder import Dencoder

d = Dencoder()
print d.encode(234)
print d.decode("xyz")
}}}

This can then be used to translate a number to a shorter ASCII encoding of the number which can then used as a unique ID.
